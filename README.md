# Fact-Bot

## Description: 
-This is an application that will send you facts that you might not have known before from a variety of sources such as reddit, and wikipedia.

##General Information
-This program is meant for those with a reddit account who also enjoy daily (intervals can be changed) random facts and articles.
-You will need to create an application registration via your reddit account to get a secret key and client id which should be stored as env variables.
-The name the env variables should be stored as can be found near the top of the script.
-This program is meant to be run on startup, hence it's adviced to make a copy of it to put in your startup directory.
-If the program does not work with pthon 2.7, be sure to update and run with a python 3 version.
-In the same folder as the file, a config.txt is created. This contains your gmail login credentials so handle with care.
